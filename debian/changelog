po4a (0.16-1) NOT RELEASED; urgency=low

  The "SGML should work. Without source change, even for (simple) XML" version
  
  * [all binaries]
    - add a -o/--option option allowing to pass options to the format plugin
  * [Sgml.pm] 
    - Try to handle xml documents, with a big fat warning that this may fail,
      and that no bug should be repported if it does not work.
      Thanks to Jordi Vilalta for suggesting that.
    - New options to add tags to the mecanism without modifying the code.
    - Detect non-master files and repport them properly. This was alioth's
      #300591 and savannah's #6438.
    - Put verbatim tags in their own msgid to avoid issues with
      mixing wrapped and non-wrapped. This was savannah's #7155.
    - Make a gentle error message when SGMLS.pm was not found.
    - Issue warnings ("hello, user. This is a feature") when msgid is
      skipped because it contains an entity alone, or because it contains
      only tags. The translation of those is always the msgid itself. 
      Thanks Jordi for falling into that trap ;)
    - Detect msgid containing one entity and spaces, and skip them also.
    - Permit the translation of entity definition (not for file including
      ones, but for the rewrite ones). Thanks Jordi for the hint.
    - Add missing tags (articleinfo, which was savannah's #8475, and some more)
  * Fix a bunch of typos repported by Francois Gouget (thanks). 
    This was savannah's #7152.
  * [t/data-02/man.po] back to 100% success on tests
    Reformating to match what we get. This does not impact the semantic of
    the file, and I belive the change is due to gettext.
  * [t/data-20/*; t/20-xml.t] New test about SGML plugin (when used in xml
    mode since it tests both mode at once)
  * [po/bin/fr.po] Complete translation. 
    [po/pod/fr.po] Complete translation of binaries man page.
    I reviewed the strings in the process and fixed some of them.

po4a (0.15.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * First official upload.  Closes: #176492
  * Fix buglets in doc/po4a.7.pod
  * Replace prefix variable by DESTDIR in debian/rules and po/bin/Makefile
    to follow GNU usage.
  * As told in section 3.1 of the Perl policy, man pages must be installed
    under section 3pm, not 3perl.
  * In debian/rules, remove the useless pods target, 'make -C po' does the
    job.
  * Make debian/rules much lighter by processing and running Makefile.PL
  * Normalize po4a-normalize, replace --help-fmt command-line flag by
    --help-format to comply with other po4a tools.
  * In Locale::Po4a::Chooser, all available formats were loaded, the
    requested one is now dynamically loaded.
  * In Locale::Po4a::Pod, remove declarations of functions when they
    are inherited from Locale::Po4a::TransTractor.
  * Some newlines were missing with the POD format, because trailing
    newlines were removed in Locale::Po4a::Pod, and some (but not all)
    were added in Locale::Po4a::Po.  These changes are removed, and
    po4a-normalize does no more lose newlines on POD files.

    debian/control: typo and line too long
    doc/po4a.7.pod: add a NAME section
  * Fix Sgml.pm:
    - apply patch from Francois Gouget to support more docbook tags. Closes
      Savannah's #2353. 
      Add some more tags to parse a sgml file I used to fix the following:
    - Fix references for composite files. Closes Savannah's #6439.
      Do report the right file and line number for composite files.

po4a (0.15.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix savannah's #5139: Bad quoting.
    Quoting is a little nightmare, but I added the provided faulty example
    in the tests, and it is fixed now.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Fri,  7 Nov 2003 15:59:42 +0100

po4a (0.15.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The long awaited version.
   
  * Fix savannah's #4975: french man page is outdated.
    - This revealed to be a grave bug in the tool itself, leading to the use
      of the fuzzy strings in translation.
    - t/10-discard-fuzzy.t is a test to make sure this bug will never come back.
  * Fix savannah's #4976: po4a.7 outdated.
    - Update the man page to reflect the new option names.
  * Fix the small glitches which made the tests to fail. 
    - Now, the testsuite is more complete, and all tests success on my box.
    - README.tests is a bit of documentation on how to repport make test
      failure.
 
 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Fri,  7 Nov 2003 13:43:17 +0100

po4a (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let's iritate the users by changing the option names" version.
  
  Major changes:
  * Change and unify all option names for the scripts.
  
  Minor changes:
  * Document a bit more the scripts.
  * Update copyright year for scripts (FIXME: not lib).

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Tue, 11 Feb 2003 23:53:11 +0100

po4a (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "One step outside Debian" version.
  
  * A proper Perl package is now build, thanks to Makefile.PL
    Next step: inclusion on CPAN ;)
  * Preliminary testsuite:
    - Every class is compilable
    - Man.pm works (test number 4 is known to fail, because diff don't work well on po files).
    - addendums work
    Still to do: other modules.
  * Fix po/pod/Makefile, to avoid tons of warnings and reflect the lib/ directory change.
    [Denis Barbier]
  * Updated documentation, thanks to Philippe for its review. One day,
    addendums will be usable...
  * Use warnings in all file
  * Add a 'no-wrap' flag to all msgid which must not be wrapped by
    po4a. This tag is valid for gettext and will be preserved by
    tools. It means something else for gettext, but this other meaning seems
    useless to me, and both uses can coexist. 
  * Man.pm:
    - don't split indented paragraphs on several msgids.
    - don't pretend we handle nested font modifier when we don't

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Fri,  7 Feb 2003 08:46:23 +0100

po4a (0.13.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * po4a-updatepo repports the status of the file after the update
  * Man.pm: handle UC and AT macro

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Thu, 23 Jan 2003 15:20:26 +0100

po4a (0.13.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make the placement of the addendum verbose when -v is passed to
    po4a-translate, thanks to the crash tests from Philippe ;)
  * More documentation improvement, thanks to the review from Philippe.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Thu, 23 Jan 2003 09:08:14 +0100

po4a (0.13.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really fix the problem I though to fix in 0.13.2

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Wed, 22 Jan 2003 10:34:38 +0100

po4a (0.13.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Man.pm: explain why we refuse to process pages generated from pod or
    sgml, document processed by db2man.xsl can be processed, since the 
    XML module of po4a isn't done yet.
  * gettextization: The fact that the original and the translated files
    don't have the same number of entries isn't fatal anymore, so that
    the user can see where there is a document structure disparity.
  * Fix problems in po4a.7.pod, thanks to Philippe Batailler.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Wed, 22 Jan 2003 08:42:30 +0100

po4a (0.13.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * TransTractor.pm: don't check for the options passed to translate,
    since I fail to make it work with the Man.pm

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Fri, 17 Jan 2003 08:39:53 +0100

po4a (0.13.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sgml.pm:
    - don't translate the footnotes separatly, since it would imply to split
      the sentence containing them.
    - put all the author description (name+surname+email+...) in the same
      msgid to ease the translator work.
      
  * Makefiles:
    - implement a stats target in po/

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Sun, 12 Jan 2003 16:49:52 +0100
 
po4a (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "housekeeping is good when you want to invite people home" version.
  
  * TransTractor: Internals cleanup: 
    - translate_wrapped() don't exist anymore, and translate() take extra
      arguments to specify if we want to wrap.
    - For internals data in the object, transtractor now use TT (it used to 
      use DOC).
    - Set the package version only in this file, and not in all.
  * Po.pm:  Internals cleanup: 
    - push_wrapped() and gettext_wrapped() disapeared also.
  * All modules: Adapt to last changes in TransTractor.pm
  * New module: Chooser.pm  
    This is not a new format, but functions to manage all formats in the
    same place. 
    Before, when I added a module, I had to change all binaries to take it
    into account.
    Now, all binaries use this module to access format modules.
  * Man.pm: cosmetic changes, to make it readable by others.
  * Sgml.pm: 
    - New dtd: docbook. 
    - Should work even in case of conditional inclusion (string references in
      po files will be wrong in that case).

    - Generated source is better looking

    - ups, added "use strict;" ;)
    - Don't use SGMLS::Output anymore. This is an old piece of crap producing
      tons of warnings when used under perl -w.
    - remove debugging output
  
 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Sun, 12 Jan 2003 16:49:52 +0100

po4a (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename po4a-identity to po4a-normalize, since it do normalize the
    source document.
  * We now have a decent documentation in po4a(7)
  * Several small bug and glitches fix all over there.
  * New module: SGML
    - This is the long awaited sgml module !
    - So far, it can handle only the debiandoc dtd but extending it to other
      ones should be quite easy. 
    - For now, this adds a strict dependence on libsgmls-perl and sp since
      I didn't implement the check for existing libraries, like debconf does 
      for curse.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Thu,  9 Jan 2003 20:53:26 +0100

po4a (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tons of bug fixes: 
    - Pod.pm shouldn't fail anymore
    - Man.pm now fail on only 3% of the pages installed on my box (because
      they are too cleaver with roff for us)
    see documentation and release note for more details
  * Polishing:
    - More argument checking to detect problems
    - Redo some parts of the documentation
    - Begin the translation of documentation to french
  * New module:
    - KernelHelp: The help messages associated with each kernel compilation 
      option

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Wed, 25 Dec 2002 19:15:28 +0100

po4a (0.10.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move lib/ to Locale/Po4a/ so that pod translations can be builded
    without build-depending on ourself
  * Add a new script po4a-identity usefull to debug po4a modules (by
    prooving they are idempotent)
  * Fix the way the bold and italics are handeled in man pages (translator
    are only faced to POD sequence B<blabla> and I<blibli>, but this was
    broken and did not work in all cases).
  * updatepo accepts non-existent po files, so that you can bootstrap a po
    file for n documents without gettextize each one and using msgcat to
    merge the results.
  * Add a Copyright and License section in all man pages
  * Fix a bug in the handling of 'pod' and 'back' commands.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Wed, 18 Dec 2002 08:08:45 +0100

po4a (0.10.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug repported by Julien Louis: Locale::Po4a::Man was not included 
    in po4a-gettextize.
  * Other bug repported by Julien Louis: indented paragraph in man pages
    shouldn't be wrapped.
  * Fix the generation of binary po files, and put the french translation.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Fri, 13 Dec 2002 07:51:00 +0100

po4a (0.10.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug repported by Julien Louis: All strings containing '\n' where
    not translated.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Thu, 12 Dec 2002 16:25:52 +0100

po4a (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * New name, one more code reorganization. Having more than one package
    implies to dupplicate code in the binaries. Ie, the difference between
    pod-gettextize and man-gettextize is only the module to load.
    I don't want to maintain the same code N times.
  * Po.pm, TransTractor.pm:
    - bug fixes
  * Man.pm:
    - first release.
    - seems ok to me (it fails on unknown macro, and shouldn't change the
      cat result).

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Wed, 11 Dec 2002 16:55:20 +0100

po-pod (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the new Locale::Po4a::TransTractor as base of the parser/extractor.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Fri, 29 Nov 2002 14:23:04 +0100

po-pod (0.8.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on the newly created liblocale-po4a-perl, and do not provide
    Po.pm anymore.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Tue, 19 Nov 2002 17:53:37 +0100

po-pod (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pod-gettextize:
    - output file defaults to standard output.
    - document the fact that all translations found during the merge are
      marked fuzzy, and why. 

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Tue, 19 Nov 2002 17:22:58 +0100

po-pod (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove {read,write} to filehandle to avoid problems when running under
    UTF8 locales.
  * Po.pm: when calling the regular gettext, prefix it with
    Locale::gettext::, so that we get the function we are looking for, and
    not the one defined in this package.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Mon, 18 Nov 2002 15:08:43 +0100

po-pod (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * pod-translate:
    - when a translation is discarded, remove the old generated file.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Mon, 18 Nov 2002 09:22:55 +0100

po-pod (0.8) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Po.pm:
    - New functions: gettext_stats, and gettext_stats_clear. Be careful
      (and read the doc ;), it's not the status of the file, it's the
      summary of its recent use through the gettext method.
    - New function: wrapped_gettext(), wrapped_push(), which do like 
      gettext() and push(), but assumes that whitespaces in msgid and 
      msgstr are not significant (and modify them).
  * pod-updatepo: INCOMPATIBLE INTERFACE CHANGE!
    - now accepts several pod files (to put their translation in only one
      file per language).  
  * pod-translate:
    - reports how much is each file translated when running verbose.
    - New option: -k set the threshold under what the translation is
      discarded. Defaults to 80. 
    - New option: -w set the width to which the resulting file should be
      wrapped. Defaults to 76.
    - New option: -a|--add-file is implemented (see man page). It's not
      specific to pod files, and should work for all modules, provided
      that they keep the file to output in a @ of lines.
  * Packaging:
    - Perl modules are now stored under /usr/share, and not /usr/lib
      because they are not arch-dependent.
    - Manpages are now installed only with dh_installman, so that we don't  
      get them twice.
    - The comments in source also says that code is GPL'ed
  * All binaries and modules:
    use (regular) gettext.pm to localize the messages ;)

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Sun, 17 Nov 2002 02:09:06 +0100

po-pod (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
