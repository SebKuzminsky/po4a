    not translated.

po4a (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * New name, one more code reorganization. Having more than one package
    implies to dupplicate code in the binaries. Ie, the difference between
    pod-gettextize and man-gettextize is only the module to load.
    I don't want to maintain the same code N times.
  * Po.pm, TransTractor.pm:
    - bug fixes
  * Man.pm:
    - first release.
    - seems ok to me (it fails on unknown macro, and shouldn't change the
      cat result.
  *

po-pod (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the new Locale::Po4a::TransTractor as base of the parser/extractor.

po-pod (0.8.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on the newly created liblocale-po4a-perl, and do not provide
    Po.pm anymore.

po-pod (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pod-gettextize:
    - output file defaults to standard output.
    - document the fact that all translations found during the merge are
      marked fuzzy, and why. 

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Tue, 19 Nov 2002 17:22:58 +0100

po-pod (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove {read,write} to filehandle to avoid problems when running under
    UTF8 locales.
  * Po.pm: when calling the regular gettext, prefix it with
    Locale::gettext::, so that we get the function we are looking for, and
    not the one defined in this package.

 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Mon, 18 Nov 2002 15:08:43 +0100

po-pod (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * pod-translate:
    - when a translation is discarded, remove the old generated file.

po-pod (0.8) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Po.pm:
    - New functions: gettext_stats, and gettext_stats_clear. Be carefull
      (and read the doc ;), it's not the status of the file, it's the
      summary of its recent use through the gettext method.
    - New function: wrapped_gettext(), wrapped_push(), which do like 
      gettext() and push(), but assumes that whitespaces in msgid and 
      msgstr are not significant (and modify them).
  * pod-updatepo: INCOMPATIBLE INTERFACE CHANGE!
    - now accepts several pod files (to put their translation in only one
      file per language).  
  * pod-translate:
    - reports how much is each file translated when running verbose.
    - New option: -k set the threshold under what the translation is
      discarded. Defaults to 80. 
    - New option: -w set the width to which the resulting file should be
      wrapped. Defaults to 76.
    - New option: -a|--add-file is implemented (see man page). It's not
      specific to pod files, and should work for all modules, provided
      that they keep the file to output in a @ of lines.
  * Packaging:
    - Perl modules are now stored under /usr/share, and not /usr/lib
      because they are not arch-dependant.
    - Manpages are now installed only with dh_installman, so that we don't  
      get them twice.
    - The comments in source also says that code is GPL'ed
  * All binaries and modules:
    use (regular) gettext.pm to localize the messages ;)
