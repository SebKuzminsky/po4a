po4a (0.24-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [Nicolas François]
  (Sgml.pm)
  * Preserve more entities. It was already the case for entities ending by a
    semi-colon, but they were expended in entities not terminated by a
    semi-colon (e.g. id="&url-debian-volatile").
  * Add the docbook docinfo tag, and remove duplicate refsect1 tag.
  (Po.pm)
  * use File::Copy::move instead of rename (the POT/POs were not written when
    /tmp and the file were not in the same device.
    Thanks to Valéry Perrin and Thomas Huriaux.
  * make filter() less verbose
    

  [Yuri Kozlov]
  * Updated russian translation (po/bin/ru.po) (Closes: #350300)

po4a (0.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Thomas Huriaux]
  (po4a)
  * only updates the POT if a master document is more recent than the existing
    POT. Closes: #339459
  * New --variable option.
  (Docbook.pm)
  * refentrytitle can be specified inside a sentence. Move this tag to the
    inline category.
  (Sgml.pm)
  * There can be spaces between the entity definition and '>'.
  * Some fixes in the line references counting mechanism.
  * Add a ignore-inclusion option. It permits to avoid including external
    entities.
  * For the conditionnal inclusions, use the <po4abeg name="..."> and
    <po4aend> tags to fool nsgml instead of the {PO4A-beg-...} and {PO4A-end},
    which caused extra tags to be added by nsgmls.
  * Do not fail when the file pointed by a system entity does not exist and
    this entity is not used.

  [Nicolas François]
  (Po.pm)
  * If a line could not be wrapped (e.g. because of a more than xx chars
    link), the rest of the paragraph was not rewrapped.
    Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  * Add a write_if_needed subroutine to check if an update is needed.
    see #339459.
  (Text.pm)
  * A new very simple module for text documents. Closes: #243753
  (po4a-gettextize)
  * support for multiple master/localized files. Closes: #319208
  (Sgml.pm)
  * Do not re-wrap the prolog entities on one line.
  * An external entity can be referenced as &entity; or &entity. The second
    case is now supported. Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  * Do not include the commented entities.
  * support for the 'qref' tag.
  * Support for the processing instructions (pi) (e.g. <?xml...?>).
  * Fix various issues when po4a is not run in the master file directory.
  (Xml.pm)
  * The inline tags were not added to the tags path. It should now be possible
    to put "<tag1><tag2>" in the 'tags' category, even if <tag1> is in the
    'inline' category.
  * The encoding declaration must be added before any standalone document
    declaration. Otherwise the document is not valid. Thanks to Olivier
    Trichet for noticing.
  * First attempt to translate the entities.
  (Docbook.pm)
  * When a tag is added to the 'inline' or 'tags' category on the command
    line, the default tags in Docbook.pm should not add this tag in the other
    ('inline' or 'tags') category.
  * New "nodefault" option, to avoid a specified tag to be set in the tags
    or inline category by defaut.
  (po4a)
  * Add a set of options that could be useful for the maintainers:
    --no-translations, --rm-translations, --no-backups, --rm-backups
  * Add a --force option that force the re-generation of the POT and PO files.
  * If the POT is updated (see Thomas change above), check that this update is
    really needed (avoids changing only the POT-Creation-Date field).
    see #339459.
  * The error message when msgmerge failed was wrong. Closes: #339453
  * Fix the --quiet option. CLoses: #342293
    Thanks to Brendan O'Dea.
  (translations)
  * Update French translation, use non-breaking spaces where needed
  * Fix a lot of typos in the French translation. Thanks to Frédéric Bothamy.
    Closes: #341175
  * Update the Swedish translation according to Rosetta
    (I can't update more languages. The update process of Rosetta is ways too
    complicated)

  * Improve speed 
  * use the nsgmls -wno-valid option to avoid some errors since we include
    all parts conditional inclusion constructs, for example.
  * fix the spacing of the verbatim blocks.
    Thanks to Julien Louis (ptitlouis) for reporting.
  * Various other little fixes and improvements
  (Man module)

    supported by po4a (untranslated, noarg, translate_joined,
    translate_each, no_wrap, inline)
  (TeX & LaTeX modules)
  * New syntax for the "% po4a:" line.
    This alow command to mix optional and mandatory arguments.
  * remove the old category (untranslated, translate_each, ...) This was
    problematic when a command is follwed by a block ({...}).
  * Update the definition of the common LaTeX commands and environments.
    All these definitions are now in the LaTeX module.
  * Allow 3 mode of separation for the commands at an extremity of a block
    (separate and translate the parameters that must be translated
    separately, separate and translate the command with its parameters, only
    separate if the command is alone in a block).
  * Allow to translate the \begin command with all its arguments attached.
  * Make error messages translatable.

    Thanks to Thomas Huriaux.
  (Xml module)
  * Do not break paragraphs on comments, just remove them.
  (Po module)
  * Restore the trailing spaces in Po.pm:wrap().
    This fix an issue with the lang attribute of an XML file ('en' was
    normalized into 'en\n').
    This needed a minor correction of Pod.pm and Sgml.pm.
  (Debian package)
  * bump Standards-Version to 3.6.2
  * do not build depend on libsgmls-perl
  * depends on ${misc:depends}, ${perl:Depends} instead of perl | perl5

  * If relative, the path of included file must be considered to be relative
    to the path of the master Sgml file.
    Fixes bug #300874 on the Alioth tracker, for the Sgml module.
  * The debug option is a space separated list of channels to print
    information for. So we must split it to set $debug.
  * Check the nsgmls exit code and issue an error if it is non-zero.
    This lets us detect the case where nsgmls is missing.
  * Add support for translating attribute values.
  * Add a 'qualify' option to denote which attributes should get an
    msgid 'qualified' by the attribute name.
  * Don't qualify the lang attribute by default for consistency with Xml.pm
  * Rename the 'attribute' option to 'attributes' for consistency with Xml.pm

  (Po module)
  * Add a porefs option controlling the file reference verbosity, and thus
    the diff verbosity.

  (Chooser)
  * Store '\$@' in an intermediate variable so it does not get clobbered
    before we report the plugin-load error.

  (binaries)

  * Remove unneeded imports of TransTractor::VERSION.

  (libraries)
  * Remove unneeded imports and exports of TransTractor::VERSION.

  (Po module)
  * Issue an useful error message when the gettextization fails because there
    is not the same amount of entries (Closes: #325314)

  [Nicolas François]
  (TeX module)

    if the argument has to be quoted.
  * Handling of input line continuation (\<RET>) should not be reserved for
    macros.
  (TeX module)
  * Add a generic TeX module:
    - it tries to separate entities that can be translated on their own (i.e.
      paragraphs, but also some commands when they are located at the
      beginning or end of these entities);
    - permits to build derivated parsers (e.g. for LaTeX, but texinfo is also
      planned);
    - allows personnalization (with '% po4a: ' lines in the tex file or a class
      file);
    - handles file inclusion.
    - customization by categories of commands
      (translated/untranslated and/or separated).
    - break paragraphs at the beginning and end of environments blocks.
    - it was tested with a book and the Python documentation

    This version has been much more tested than 0.17 and many bugs

  [Jordi Vilalta]
  - [Xml.pm] Improved attributes matching when there's no tag hierarchy in

    - po4a-updatepo: was rather poor. Closes #264537 in Debian
    - Sgml.pm: induced a perl error (not enough args for format).
      Thanks Olivier Trichet for the last one, and Danilo for the others.
  - Various documentation & messages improvements
  - [translation] Update po/bin/fr.po
  (TransTractor)
  - Do not try (and fail miserably) to create path to output file when it's
    in the current directory (also in Po.pm).
  - [addendum] change a 'while (shift @toto) {}' to a 
    'do {shift; bla} while (scalar @toto)' so that we proceed even if @toto
    contains empty strings. (Clauses: #265383) of Debian
  (Sgml)
  - stop pushline()ing empty strings since it breaks TransTractor. Also
    closes Debian's #265383. Yup, this bug is fixed twice. Slam!
  (Man)
  - Fix tests so that they stop make sure that the nf/fi bug of man is still
    there. Test that it does not come back instead.
  - Convert on the fly the groff horror \*(lqlibc5\*(rq, which stands for
    "libc5", with the quotes. Thanks to Phillipe Batailler for bringing my
    attention to this.
  - Add support for the groff builtin registers and for the ms
    "Displays and keeps" macros. This was needed to deal with the man pages
    of shadow and dpkg.
  - No groff nbsp (ie '\ ') on the last pos of the line, or groff adds an
    extra space. Thanks to Nicolas Francois for the info. 
  - Convert \- to - on the fly. The asteatic of the printed man page may
    suffer (a hyphen is different of a minus sign in ps/pdf), but makes
    translator's life easier. Thanks to Nicolas Francois for the expertise.
  - Stick to groff_man(7) intead of man(7), and consider that when IP is
    given only one argument, that's the designator (which we have to
    translate) instead of the column indentation. Thanks Francois.
  - Deal properly with '\ ' in macro arguments. Ie, stop changing 
    '.BI -a\  addresses' to '.BI "-a addresses"' (but to .BI "-a " addresses)
  - Do not eat \ at the end of the line (and put the next one on the same
    line) when we're not on a macro definition line.
  (po4a)
  - Kill the code checking that the first argument contains no colon, since
    the filename can contain colons. This triggers false positives here.

po4a (0.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  SGML should work. Without source change, even for (simple) XML.
  Addition of a Dia module by Jordi Vilalta.
  
  Martin Quinson
  * [all binaries]
    - add a -o/--option flag allowing to pass options to the format plugin
  * [Sgml.pm] 
    - Try to handle XML documents, with a big fat warning that this may fail,
      and that no bug should be reported if it does not work.
      Thanks to Jordi Vilalta for suggesting that.
    - New options to add tags to the mechanism without modifying the code.
    - Detect non-master files and report them properly. This was alioth's
      #300591 and savannah's #6438.
    - Put verbatim tags in their own msgid to avoid issues with
      mixing wrapped and non-wrapped. This was savannah's #7155.
    - Make a gentle error message when SGMLS.pm was not found.
    - Issue warnings ("hello, user. This is a feature") when msgid is
      skipped because it contains an entity alone, or because it contains
      only tags. The translation of those is always the msgid itself. 
      Thanks Jordi for falling into that trap ;)
    - Detect msgid containing one entity and spaces, and skip them also.
    - Add a 'include-all' option preventing the optimization described on
      two previous items.
    - Permit the translation of entity definition (not for file including
      ones, but for the rewrite ones). Thanks Jordi for the hint.
    - Add missing tags (articleinfo, which was savannah's #8475, and some more)
  * Fix a bunch of typos reported by Francois Gouget (thanks). 
    This was savannah's #7152.
  * [t/data-02/man.po] back to 100% success on tests
    Reformatting to match what we get. This does not impact the semantic of
    the file, and I believe the change is due to gettext.
  * [t/data-20/*; t/20-xml.t] New test about SGML plugin (when used in XML
    mode since it tests both modes at once)
  * [po/bin/fr.po] Complete translation. 
    [po/pod/fr.po] Complete translation of binaries man page.
    I reviewed the strings in the process and fixed some of them.

  Denis Barbier
  * Call 'xgettext -L Perl' instead of '-L c' to extract messages from
    Perl scripts.  
  * Remove trailing newlines from gettext messages.

  Jordi Vilalta
  * [po/bin/es.po] Add Spanish translation
  * [Dia.pm] New module for the diagrams saved by dia program
  * [t/21-dia.t  t/data-21] Relevant tests

po4a (0.15.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * First official upload.  Closes: #176492
  * Fix buglets in doc/po4a.7.pod
  * Replace prefix variable by DESTDIR in debian/rules and po/bin/Makefile
    to follow GNU usage.
  * As told in section 3.1 of the Perl policy, man pages must be installed
    under section 3pm, not 3perl.
  * In debian/rules, remove the useless pods target, 'make -C po' does the
    job.
  * Make debian/rules much lighter by processing and running Makefile.PL
  * Normalize po4a-normalize, replace --help-fmt command-line flag by
    --help-format to comply with other po4a tools.
  * In Locale::Po4a::Chooser, all available formats were loaded, the
    requested one is now dynamically loaded.
  * In Locale::Po4a::Pod, remove declarations of functions when they
    are inherited from Locale::Po4a::TransTractor.
  * Some newlines were missing with the POD format, because trailing
    newlines were removed in Locale::Po4a::Pod, and some (but not all)
    were added in Locale::Po4a::Po.  These changes are removed, and
    po4a-normalize does no more lose newlines on POD files.

    debian/control: typo and line too long
    doc/po4a.7.pod: add a NAME section
  * Fix Sgml.pm:
    - apply patch from Francois Gouget to support more docbook tags. Closes
      Savannah's #2353. 
      Add some more tags to parse a sgml file I used to fix the following:
    - Fix references for composite files. Closes Savannah's #6439.

po4a (0.15.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The long awaited version.
   
  * Fix savannah's #4975: french man page is outdated.
    - This revealed to be a grave bug in the tool itself, leading to the use
      of the fuzzy strings in translation.
    - t/10-discard-fuzzy.t is a test to make sure this bug will never come back.
  * Fix savannah's #4976: po4a.7 outdated.
    - Update the man page to reflect the new option names.
  * Fix the small glitches which made the tests to fail. 
    - Now, the testsuite is more complete, and all tests success on my box.
    - README.tests is a bit of documentation on how to report make test
      failure.

po4a (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "One step outside Debian" version.
  
  * A proper Perl package is now build, thanks to Makefile.PL
    Next step: inclusion on CPAN ;)
  * Preliminary testsuite:
    - Every class is compilable
    - Man.pm works (test number 4 is known to fail, because diff don't work well on po files).
    - addendums work
    Still to do: other modules.
  * Fix po/pod/Makefile, to avoid tons of warnings and reflect the lib/ directory change.
    [Denis Barbier]
  * Updated documentation, thanks to Philippe for its review. One day,
    addendums will be usable...
  * Use warnings in all file
  * Add a 'no-wrap' flag to all msgid which must not be wrapped by
    po4a. This tag is valid for gettext and will be preserved by
    tools. It means something else for gettext, but this other meaning seems
    useless to me, and both uses can coexist. 
  * Man.pm:
    - don't split indented paragraphs on several msgids.
    - don't pretend we handle nested font modifier when we don't

po4a (0.13.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Man.pm: explain why we refuse to process pages generated from pod or
    sgml, document processed by db2man.xsl can be processed, since the 
    XML module of po4a isn't done yet.
  * gettextization: The fact that the original and the translated files
    don't have the same number of entries isn't fatal anymore, so that
    the user can see where there is a document structure disparity.
  * Fix problems in po4a.7.pod, thanks to Philippe Batailler.

      msgid to ease the translator work.

po4a (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "housekeeping is good when you want to invite people home" version.
  
  * TransTractor: Internals cleanup: 
    - translate_wrapped() don't exist anymore, and translate() take extra
      arguments to specify if we want to wrap.
    - For internals data in the object, transtractor now use TT (it used to 
      use DOC).
    - Set the package version only in this file, and not in all.
  * Po.pm:  Internals cleanup: 
    - push_wrapped() and gettext_wrapped() disapeared also.
  * All modules: Adapt to last changes in TransTractor.pm
  * New module: Chooser.pm  
    This is not a new format, but functions to manage all formats in the
    same place. 
    Before, when I added a module, I had to change all binaries to take it
    into account.
    Now, all binaries use this module to access format modules.
  * Man.pm: cosmetic changes, to make it readable by others.
  * Sgml.pm: 
    - New dtd: docbook. 
    - Should work even in case of conditional inclusion (string references in
      po files will be wrong in that case).

    - Generated source is better looking

    - ups, added "use strict;" ;)
    - Don't use SGMLS::Output anymore. This is an old piece of crap producing
      tons of warnings when used under perl -w.
    - remove debugging output
  
 -- Martin Quinson <martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org>  Sun, 12 Jan 2003 16:49:52 +0100

po4a (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename po4a-identity to po4a-normalize, since it do normalize the
    source document.
  * We now have a decent documentation in po4a(7)
  * Several small bug and glitches fix all over there.
  * New module: SGML
    - This is the long awaited sgml module !
    - So far, it can handle only the debiandoc dtd but extending it to other
      ones should be quite easy. 
    - For now, this adds a strict dependence on libsgmls-perl and sp since
      I didn't implement the check for existing libraries, like debconf does 
      for curse.

      they are too cleaver with roff for us)
    see documentation and release note for more details
  * Polishing:
    - More argument checking to detect problems
    - Redo some parts of the documentation
    - Begin the translation of documentation to french
  * New module:

po4a (0.10.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move lib/ to Locale/Po4a/ so that pod translations can be builded
    without build-depending on ourself
  * Add a new script po4a-identity usefull to debug po4a modules (by
    prooving they are idempotent)
  * Fix the way the bold and italics are handeled in man pages (translator
    are only faced to POD sequence B<blabla> and I<blibli>, but this was
    broken and did not work in all cases).
  * updatepo accepts non-existent po files, so that you can bootstrap a po
    file for n documents without gettextize each one and using msgcat to
    merge the results.
  * Add a Copyright and License section in all man pages
  * Fix a bug in the handling of 'pod' and 'back' commands.

po4a (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * New name, one more code reorganization. Having more than one package
    implies to dupplicate code in the binaries. Ie, the difference between
    pod-gettextize and man-gettextize is only the module to load.
    I don't want to maintain the same code N times.
  * Po.pm, TransTractor.pm:
    - bug fixes
  * Man.pm:
    - first release.
    - seems ok to me (it fails on unknown macro, and shouldn't change the
      cat result).

po-pod (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove {read,write} to filehandle to avoid problems when running under
    UTF8 locales.
  * Po.pm: when calling the regular gettext, prefix it with
    Locale::gettext::, so that we get the function we are looking for, and
    not the one defined in this package.

po-pod (0.8) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Po.pm:
    - New functions: gettext_stats, and gettext_stats_clear. Be careful
      (and read the doc ;), it's not the status of the file, it's the
      summary of its recent use through the gettext method.
    - New function: wrapped_gettext(), wrapped_push(), which do like 
      gettext() and push(), but assumes that whitespaces in msgid and 
      msgstr are not significant (and modify them).
  * pod-updatepo: INCOMPATIBLE INTERFACE CHANGE!
    - now accepts several pod files (to put their translation in only one
      file per language).  
  * pod-translate:
    - reports how much is each file translated when running verbose.
    - New option: -k set the threshold under what the translation is
      discarded. Defaults to 80. 
    - New option: -w set the width to which the resulting file should be
      wrapped. Defaults to 76.
    - New option: -a|--add-file is implemented (see man page). It's not
      specific to pod files, and should work for all modules, provided
      that they keep the file to output in a @ of lines.
  * Packaging:
    - Perl modules are now stored under /usr/share, and not /usr/lib
      because they are not arch-dependent.
    - Manpages are now installed only with dh_installman, so that we don't  
      get them twice.
    - The comments in source also says that code is GPL'ed
  * All binaries and modules:
    use (regular) gettext.pm to localize the messages ;)
